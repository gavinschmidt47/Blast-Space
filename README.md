###WHAT I DID###
Every single aspect of this game, except for the tilemap, was made by hand for a class at UCF. We were given a week and a half to come up with a simple 'WarioWare'-inspired game and create it. I have always enjoyed timing-based games and working to beat my own or others' high scores. So, I designed a simple-looking game with fun, randomly spawning enemies that can collide with each other and move around. Since I created this project alone, I was able to ensure every aspect of the game fit my theme and worked together in harmony. The sprite of the Blaster and the enemy are meant to have a similar feeling and presence in the scene. However, they are notably different from the tilemap to create a feeling of unease and unnaturalness. Additionally, because the game is set to a timer and becomes very fast-paced, I made the music emphasize the unease and pressure of time.
